## Introduction

### Project Objective

The goal of this mini-project is to develop a desktop application that can dynamically generate a user interface based on the structure of an existing database. This application will allow users to view tables and their contents, as well as perform data management operations such as adding, updating, and deleting records. The application aims to simplify database interaction by providing an intuitive and easy-to-use graphical interface, reducing the need for advanced technical skills to manipulate data.

### Application Overview

The application is a desktop software solution designed to interact with relational databases. Key features include:

1. **Database Connection**: 
   - Allows users to connect to a database by providing necessary information such as database type (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), server address, database name, and login credentials.

2. **Table Display**:
   - Retrieves and displays a list of tables present in the connected database, enabling users to select a table to view its content or perform management operations.

3. **Table Content Visualization**:
   - Displays the content of selected tables in a tabular format, allowing users to browse existing records visually and in a structured manner.

4. **CRUD Operations**:
   - **Add Record**: A dedicated form allows users to add new records to a table, with dynamically generated fields based on the table structure.
   - **Edit Record**: Users can select and update an existing record using a form similar to the add record form.
   - **Delete Record**: A delete button is available for each record, allowing users to remove it from the database.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Designed with a clear and intuitive user interface, making navigation and usage easy for non-technical users. Features are accessible via well-organized menus and buttons.

## Technologies Used

For developing the "Générateur d'Interface DB" application, the following technologies were used:

1. **Programming Language**:
   - **C#**: A modern and powerful language, ideal for developing robust and high-performance desktop applications.

2. **Development Environment**:
   - **Visual Studio**: A comprehensive and feature-rich Integrated Development Environment (IDE), offering advanced development tools, an integrated debugger, and excellent support for C# and .NET.

3. **Framework**:
   - **.NET**: A flexible and cross-platform development framework, enabling the creation of high-performance desktop applications with efficient resource management and advanced features.

4. **Supported Databases**:
   - The application is designed to be compatible with several common relational database management systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL, offering maximum flexibility.

5. **Version Control**:
   - **Git**: A distributed version control system, allowing tracking of source code changes and efficient collaboration with other developers.
   - **GitHub**: A platform for sharing and collaborating on source code, facilitating version management and issue tracking.

## Desktop Application Features

- **Database Connectivity**: Easily connect to various relational databases.
- **Table Management**: View and manage tables and their contents.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform create, read, update, and delete operations on database records.
- **Intuitive UI**: User-friendly interface designed for ease of use by non-technical users.
